Question: I am in the process of using masonry on a concrete form wall that isn't in contact with the ground. I need to understand what the rules are for anchoring the masonry to masonry piers.


Relevant Building Code Sections:


============================================================
Section 1: 9.20.5.1.
============================================================
Title: Masonry Support
Context: Masonry Support > Masonry and Insulating Concrete Form Walls Not In Contact with the Ground

Content:
1) All masonry shall be supported on masonry, concrete or steel, except that
masonry veneer walls may be supported on _foundations_ of wood frame constructed in
conformance with Sentence 9.15.2.4.(1). (See Note A-9.20.5.1.(1).)

2) Every masonry wall shall be at least as thick as the wall it supports, except as
otherwise permitted in Article 9.20.12.2.

Title: Corbelling for Cavity Walls
Content: 1) _Cavity walls_ of greater thickness than the _foundation_ wall on which they rest
shall not be corbelled but may project 25 mm over the outer face of the _foundation_
wall disregarding parging.

2) Where the _foundation_ wall referred to in Sentence (1) is unit masonry, it is
permitted to be corbelled to meet flush with the inner face of a _cavity wall_ provided
a) the projection of each course does not exceed half the height or one third the
thickness of the corbelled unit, and
b) the total corbel does not exceed one third of the _foundation_ wall thickness.
(See Note A-9.20.12.2.(2).)

Referenced Section: 9.15.2.4.
Title: Wood-Frame Foundations
Content: 1) _Foundations_ of wood-frame construction shall conform to
a) CSA S406, “Specification of permanent wood foundations for housing and
small buildings,” or
b) Part 4.
(See Note A-9.15.2.4.(1).)

Title: Anchoring to Masonry Piers
Context: Anchorage of Roofs, Floors and Intersecting Walls > Masonry and Insulating Concrete Form Walls Not In Contact with the Ground

Content:
1) Where anchor bolts are to be placed in the top of a masonry pier, the pier shall
conform to the requirements of Sentence 9.15.2.3.(4) and shall be capped with concrete
or reinforced masonry not less than 200 mm thick.

Referenced Section: 9.15.2.3.
Title: Pier-Type Foundations
Content: 1) Where pier-type _foundations_ are used, the piers shall be designed to support the
applied loads from the superstructure.

2) Where piers are used as a _foundation_ system in a _building_ of 1 _storey_ in _building_
_height_, the piers shall be installed to support the principal framing members and shall
be spaced not more than 3.5 m apart along the framing, unless the piers and their
footings are designed for larger spacings.

3) The height of piers described in Sentence (2) shall not exceed 3 times their
least dimension at the base of the pier.

4) Where concrete block is used for piers described in Sentence (2), they shall be
laid with cores placed vertically, and where the width of the _building_ is 4.3 m or less,
placed with their longest dimension at right angles to the longest dimension of the
_building_ .

Section 3: 9.20.11.1.
============================================================
Title: Anchorage to Floor or Roof Assemblies where Masonry Walls Require
Context: Anchorage of Roofs, Floors and Intersecting Walls > Masonry and Insulating Concrete Form Walls Not In Contact with the Ground

Content:
Lateral Support

1) Where required to receive lateral support (see Subsection 9.20.10.), masonry
walls shall be anchored to each floor or roof assembly at maximum intervals of 2 m,
except that anchorage to floor joists not more than 1 m above _grade_ may be omitted.

2) Anchors required in Sentence (1) shall be corrosion-resistant and be not less
than the equivalent of 40 mm by 4.76 mm thick steel straps.

3) Anchors required in Sentence (1) shall be shaped to provide a mechanical key
with the masonry and shall be securely fastened to the horizontal support to develop
the full strength of the anchor.

4) When joists are parallel to the wall, anchors required in Sentence (1) shall
extend across not less than 3 joists.
