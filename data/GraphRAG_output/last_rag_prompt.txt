Section 1: 9.23.9.9.
============================================================
Title: Cantilevered Floor Joists
Context: Floor Joists > Wood-Frame Construction

Content:
1) Floor joists supporting roof loads shall not be cantilevered more than 400 mm
beyond their supports where 38 mm by 184 mm joists are used and not more than

2) The cantilevered portions referred to in Sentence (1) shall not support floor
loads from other _storeys_ unless calculations are provided to show that the design
resistances of the cantilevered joists are not exceeded.

3) Where cantilevered floor joists described in Sentences (1) and (2) are at right
angles to the main floor joists, the tail joists in the cantilevered portion shall extend
inward away from the cantilever support a distance equal to not less than 6 times the
length of the cantilever, and shall be end nailed to an interior doubled header joist in
conformance with Table 9.23.3.4.

Section 2: 9.23.9.2.
============================================================
Title: Joists Supported by Beams
Context: Floor Joists > Wood-Frame Construction

Content:
1) Floor joists may be supported on the tops of beams or may be framed into
the sides of beams.

2) When framed into the side of a wood beam, joists referred to in Sentence (1)
shall be supported on
a) joist hangers or other acceptable mechanical connectors, or
b) not less than 38 mm by 64 mm ledger strips nailed to the side of the beam,
except that 38 mm by 38 mm ledger strips may be used provided each joist
is nailed to the beam by not less than four 89 mm nails, in addition to the
nailing for the ledger strip required in Table 9.23.3.4.

3) When framed into the side of a steel beam, joists referred to in Sentence (1) shall
be supported on the bottom flange of the beam or on not less than 38 mm by 38 mm
lumber bolted to the web with not less than 6.3 mm diam bolts spaced not more than

4) Joists referred to in Sentence (3) shall be spliced above the beam with not less
than 38 mm by 38 mm lumber at least 600 mm long to support the flooring.

5) Not less than a 12 mm space shall be provided between the splice required in
Sentence (4) and the beam to allow for shrinkage of the wood joists.

Section 3: 9.23.9.3.
============================================================
Title: Restraint of Joist Bottoms
Context: Floor Joists > Wood-Frame Construction

Content:
1) Except as provided in Sentence 9.23.9.4.(1), bottoms of floor joists shall be
restrained from twisting at each end by toe-nailing to the supports, end-nailing to the
header joists or by providing continuous strapping, blocking between the joists or
cross-bridging near the supports.

1) Except as permitted by Sentence (5), where strapping is specified in Span
Table 9.23.4.2.-A, it shall be
a) not less than 19 mm by 64 mm, nailed to the underside of floor joists,
b) located not more than 2 100 mm from each support or other rows of
strapping, and
c) fastened at each end to a sill or header.

2) Where bridging is specified in Span Table 9.23.4.2.-A, it shall consist of not
less than 19 mm by 64 mm or 38 mm by 38 mm cross bridging located not more than

3) Where bridging and strapping are specified in Span Table 9.23.4.2.-A,
a) bridging shall
i) comply with Sentence (2), or
ii) consist of 38 mm solid blocking located not more than

securely fastened between the joists, and
b) except as provided in Sentence (5), strapping shall comply with Sentence (1)
and be installed under the bridging.

a) bridging as described in Sentence (2), or
b) 38 mm solid blocking located not more than 2 100 mm from each support or
other rows of bridging and securely fastened between the joists.

5) Strapping described in Sentence (1) and Clause (3)(b) is not required where
a) furring strips complying with Table 9.29.3.1. are fastened directly to the
joists, or
b) a panel-type ceiling finish complying with Subsection 9.29.5., 9.29.6., 9.29.7.,
9.29.8., or 9.29.9. is attached directly to the joists.

6) Where a ceiling attached to wood furring is specified in Span Table 9.23.4.2.-B,
