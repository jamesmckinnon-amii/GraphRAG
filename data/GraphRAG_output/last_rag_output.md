Based on the provided sections of the National Building Code, specifically 9.20.11.6., the rules for anchoring masonry to masonry piers are as follows:

When using anchor bolts placed in the top of a masonry pier to anchor your masonry, the pier must meet specific requirements:

1.  **Pier Conformance:** The masonry pier must conform to the requirements of Sentence 9.15.2.3.(4) (Sentence 9.20.11.6.(1)).
2.  **Pier Cap:** The pier shall be capped with concrete or reinforced masonry that is not less than 200 mm thick (Sentence 9.20.11.6.(1)).

To elaborate on the pier conformance mentioned in 9.15.2.3.(4):

*   **Applicability:** This specific requirement applies to piers described in Sentence 9.15.2.3.(2), which are piers used as a foundation system in a building of 1 storey in building height, supporting principal framing members, and spaced not more than 3.5 m apart along the framing, unless designed for larger spacings.
*   **Concrete Block Pier Construction:** If concrete block is used for these piers, they shall be laid with their cores placed vertically. Furthermore, if the width of the building is 4.3 m or less, the concrete blocks must be placed with their longest dimension at right angles to the longest dimension of the building (Sentence 9.15.2.3.(4)).

It is important to note that while Section 9.20.5.1. addresses the general support requirements for masonry, and 9.20.11.1. deals with anchoring masonry walls to floor or roof assemblies for lateral support, Section 9.20.11.6. specifically governs the anchoring *to* masonry piers using anchor bolts.
