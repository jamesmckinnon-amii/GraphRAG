Based on the provided sections of the National Building Code, here's what you need to know about attaching your cantilevered floor joist to an interior joist:

The key requirements for the attachment of cantilevered floor joists, specifically their "tail joists" to an interior doubled header joist, are found in **Section 9.23.9.9.**

1.  **Tail Joist Extension:**
    *   The inward portion of the cantilevered floor joists (referred to as "tail joists") must extend *inward away from the cantilever support* a distance equal to **not less than 6 times the length of the cantilever** (Sentence 9.23.9.9.(3)).

2.  **Attachment Method:**
    *   These tail joists shall be **end nailed to an interior doubled header joist** (Sentence 9.23.9.9.(3)).

3.  **Nailing Requirements:**
    *   The end nailing must conform to **Table 9.23.3.4.** (Sentence 9.23.9.9.(3)).
    *   Looking at **Table 9.23.3.4**, the most applicable detail for "end nailing to an interior doubled header joist" is "End-joist or end-rafter to built-up wall stud(4)". A doubled header joist is considered a built-up member for this purpose.
        *   **Minimum Length of Nails:** 76 mm
        *   **Minimum Number of Nails:** 5 or 8 (The '(5)' in the table typically refers to a footnote providing clarification, but without it, both numbers are presented as options within the code snippet provided).

**Important Considerations for Cantilevered Joists (as referenced in 9.23.9.9.(3)):**

*   **Maximum Cantilever Length:** For 38 mm by 184 mm joists, the cantilever shall not exceed 400 mm (Sentence 9.23.9.9.(1)).
*   **Support of Other Storeys:** Cantilevered portions generally shall not support floor loads from other storeys unless specific calculations are provided to demonstrate the design resistances are not exceeded (Sentence 9.23.9.9.(2)).

While Section 9.23.9.3. (Restraint of Joist Bottoms) generally requires joist bottoms to be restrained from twisting at each end by end-nailing to header joists, among other methods, Sentence 9.23.9.9.(3) provides the specific, detailed requirements for the unique condition of cantilevered tail joists connecting to an interior doubled header.
